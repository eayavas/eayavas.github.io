    <div class="content-block">
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have been working in computer technologies for over a decade, with a focus on operating systems, embedded software development, and information security. Beyond my professional work, I am a dedicated advocate of free and open-source software.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Linux has been my platform of choice since I first became interested in computers. While it remains the primary environment for my operating systems work, I aim to focus my future research and development specifically on ARM architecture and IoT systems.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am deeply engaged with Hackerspace culture, particularly regarding privacy, digital rights, and freedoms. To support these concepts with a strong technical foundation, I am currently focused on advancing my expertise decentralized systems and in various domains of computer security.</p>
