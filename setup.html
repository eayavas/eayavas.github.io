        <p>&emsp;I believe that a researcher's environment reflects their thinking process. I prefer minimalist, keyboard-centric workflows that allow me to touch the system's core. Here is a detailed look at my hardware and software stack.</p>

    <span class="section-title"># Workstations & Architecture</span>
    <div class="content-block">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Daily Driver: MacOS (ARM64)</strong><br>
                Used for portable work, battery efficiency, and Unix-based stability.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Deep Work: Arch Linux (x86_64)</strong><br>
                My main development rig. Customized for total control.<br>
                <i>WM: Sway (Wayland Tiling WM) - for distraction-free working.</i>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Experimental: PowerPC & RISC</strong><br>
                I enjoy experimenting with older or alternative architectures like PowerPC to understand low-level differences in instruction sets and memory management.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <span class="section-title"># Development Environment (The Editor)</span>
    <div class="content-block">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Editor: Neovim</strong><br>
                I use a heavily modified Neovim configuration written in Lua. It is designed to be lightning-fast and entirely keyboard-driven. Also VSCode is used for specific tasks.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Shell & Terminal</strong><br>
                Preferred Terminal app is Ghostty. Zsh / Bash with custom scripts for automation. I prefer clean prompts and minimal latency.
            </li>
