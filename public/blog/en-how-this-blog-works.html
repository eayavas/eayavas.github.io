        <p>When I decided to add a blog section to my website, I needed
        a method that would preserve the minimalist structure of my main
        ‘CV’ pages and keep the overall architecture simple.</p>
        <p>I could, of course, have manually created separate HTML files
        for each post. However, this approach was cumbersome for content
        creation and lacked flexibility; changing a single design
        element across all posts would require revising every page
        individually.</p>
        <p>After researching practical methods for static sites, I
        decided against using heavy, pre-existing static site generators
        (like Jekyll or Hugo). Instead, I opted to solve this using a
        <strong>custom, lightweight script and Markdown</strong>.</p>
