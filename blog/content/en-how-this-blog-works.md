## How This Blog Works

When I decided to add a blog section to my website, I needed a method that would preserve the minimalist structure of my main 'CV' pages and keep the overall architecture simple.

I could, of course, have manually created separate HTML files for each post. However, this approach was cumbersome for content creation and lacked flexibility; changing a single design element across all posts would require revising every page individually.

After researching practical methods for static sites, I decided against using heavy, pre-existing static site generators (like Jekyll or Hugo). Instead, I opted to solve this using a **custom, lightweight script and Markdown**.
